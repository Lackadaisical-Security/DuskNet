## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Configuration Security
```rust
// Use strongest quantum-resistant settings
let config = DuskNetConfig {
    quantum_resistance: QuantumLevel::Maximum,
    steganography: SteganographyLevel::Advanced,
    forward_secrecy: true,
    traffic_analysis_resistance: true,
};
```

#### Key Management
- Generate keys with cryptographically secure random number generators
- Store private keys in secure key stores (HSM when available)
- Rotate keys regularly (recommended: every 30 days)
- Use different keys for different purposes

#### Network Security
- Always verify peer certificates
- Use mutual authentication when possible
- Enable traffic padding and timing randomization
- Monitor for unusual network patterns

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- Follow Rust secure coding practices
- Use `cargo audit` for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Enable all compiler warnings and treat them as errors
- Use memory-safe patterns even in unsafe blocks

#### Code Review
- All cryptographic code requires 2+ reviewer approval
- Security-sensitive changes require security team review
- External security audits for major releases
- Automated security testing in CI/CD

#### Testing
```bash
# Run security tests
cargo test --features security-tests

# Cryptographic test vectors
cargo test crypto::tests

# Steganography detection resistance
cargo test steganography::resistance_tests

# Protocol analysis tests
cargo test protocol::analysis_tests
```
