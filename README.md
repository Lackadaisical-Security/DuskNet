# 🌐 DUSKNET - Steganographic Shadow Networking Stack

## 🔒 TITLE: DuskNet v1.0 — Covert Internet Over Internet Protocol (CIOIP)

**DuskNet** is a stealth networking framework that establishes a concealed, encrypted communication infrastructure *within* the visible internet, designed to be untraceable, uncorrelatable, and unknowable.

> "DuskNet doesn't hide your location — it hides the existence of the location itself."

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run core networking engine
./target/release/dusttunnel

# Deploy ephemeral relay
python3 orchestrator/deploy_relay.py
```

## 📦 Module Structure

- **core/** - Low-level C/ASM networking and crypto components
- **dusttunnel/** - Core covert networking engine (Rust)
- **stegopack/** - Packet steganography and media injection
- **ghostbridge/** - Protocol shuffling and route camouflage
- **obscura/** - Anti-traffic-analysis engine
- **cryptweave/** - 10-layer quad-hybrid encryption
- **failsafe/** - Security and termination handlers
- **dropnet/** - Relay deployment and node spawning
- **orchestrator/** - Python control interface
- **gui/** - TUI/GUI interfaces

## 🔐 Security Features

- 40 cryptographic iterations per payload cycle
- Multi-protocol steganography (DNS, images, video)
- AI-powered traffic morphology
- Ephemeral relay mesh with self-healing
- Zero-fingerprint endpoint handling
- Biometric kill switches and distress modes

## 📋 Build Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- Python 3.9+
- GCC/Clang with inline assembly support
- libsodium, libpcap development headers
- Qt5/6 (optional, for GUI)
